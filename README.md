Frontend Final Project
By: SY, Justin Gabriel 


As of September 4, 2024, 12:28 AM, I have removed the ClerkJS functionality as it has a paywall to upload into production environment (does not accept Vercel.app). 

ATutors is a tutoring platform that uses the power of video conferencing to enable users to build a community that will help each other become more skilled and get the marks they need in undergraduate courses such as English, Math, and Science, among many. Although specifically tailored towards Arenean students, I wanted to make this technical solution more usable to all, by making a homepage that allows people to connect with each other on the website, through similar functionalities found in Zoom or Google Meet. It is through this website that I hope to be able to reach to young individuals and help them have an additional gateway to learn and grow together.
